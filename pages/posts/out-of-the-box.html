<h4>Responsive website</h4>
<p>The website is built with self defined framework using SCSS. Header autoplays movie trailer in the background on mute, it transitions into static movie poster when on medium and small screens.</p>

<h4>Mobile app</h4>
<p>The application lets you quickly select screening location and time, then register with one simple tap. Given the consideration of large smartphone screens, the menu bar sits on bottom of the app, to be easily accessed by swipe and tap.</p>
